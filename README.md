# Habit Garden
Habit Garden will be an Android app which will help the user form better habits. The habits that the user is currently pursuing are presented in the form of a flower garden in which each flower represents a habit. When the user chooses to develop a new habit, they can choose a flower to plant in their garden. Habits can be chosen from a predefined list and will include various habits meant to improve the user's life, for example giving up smoking, reading more, eating healthier, using less social media etc. When choosing a habit, the user will also choose a list of times at which the app will prompt the user to confirm that they have actually done the task associated with the habit. In order to discourage the user from lying and saying that they have done the tasks when they have not, they will have to fill out certain details specific to the tasks, like giving a short description of what they have actually done. If the user fails to confirm that they did the task, their plant will slowly die by losing petals. If the user fails repeatedly to do the tasks, the plant will die and will remain in the garden to remind them of their failure. But if the user is able to confirm doing the tasks, their plant will grow and they will earn some form of virtual currency with which they will be able to buy various garden decorations, protect their habit streak and remove dead flowers. After a certain amount of time, for example 60 days, the user will be asked if they feel that they have developed the desired habit and want to end it, or if they want to continue.
